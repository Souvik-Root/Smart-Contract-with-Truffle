# Smart-Contract-with-Truffle

## Truffle Tutorial for Beginners - Installation, Contract Creation (1/4)
1. In this tutorial we created a basic truffle project. 
2. After initializing the project we create a new "HelloWorld" Contract. 
3. We then compile the contract. 
4. Then we create our first migration file. 
5. Once migration file is ready, we initiate the dev chains (with some default values).
6. Last step is to deploy the helloworld contact to the chain. 
7. We learn to instantiate the contract instance and call its function.

## Truffle Tutorial for Beginners - Migrations, Deployment (2/4)
1. In this tutorial we expand on the Helloworld contract and add constructor, getter and setter functions for a message variable.
2. We then assign a condition to allow a minimum eth amount to be transacted along with function call. We also learn how to call these functions.
3. We create more functions and also ensure that the calls are made by the owner. 
4. Finally we create another contract and then instantiate the second  contract from the first one using the same migration file. 

## Truffle Tutorial for Beginners - Testing (3/4)
1. In this module we learn how to create test cases and assert the expected outcomes of each test.
